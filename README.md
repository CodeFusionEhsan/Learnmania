LearnMania is an E-learning Platform built with Next.js(14.0 with App Router). The website features a complete Authentication and Authorization system built with Auth0. As for the backend, I have used Next.js to write APIs. MongoDB is used as the database for the project. LearnMania is an interactive place to share and gain knowledge. The main idea of the projject is to keep everything "free". Instructors who are willing to share their knowledge for free can use this platform efficiently and it would also prove to be a one stop destination for students to learn & grow. Cloudinary is used to manage Media Upload . For Efficient UI generation Tailwind is used in the project.
